## Description

SentenceDetectorDL (SDDL) is based on a general-purpose neural network model for sentence boundary detection. The task of sentence boundary detection is to identify sentences within a text. Many natural language processing tasks take a sentence as an input unit, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition or machine translation.

In this model, we treated the sentence boundary detection task as a classification problem based on a paper {Deep-EOS: General-Purpose Neural Networks for Sentence Boundary Detection (2020, Stefan Schweter, Sajawel Ahmed) using CNN architecture. We also modified the original implemenation a little bit to cover broken sentences and some impossible end of line chars.

We are releasing two pretrained SDDL models: english and multilanguage that are trained on SETimes corpus (Tyers and Alperen, 2010) and Europarl. Wong et al. (2014) datasets.
